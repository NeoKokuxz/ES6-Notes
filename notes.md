## Let vs. Var
- Let 
  - can reassign value
  - doesn't leak outside of block scope like {}
- Var 
  - can reassign value 
  - can leak outside of scope, only temporary inside function scope
- Const
  - can't reassign value
  - doesn't leak outside of block scope {}
  - Exception : const object's property can be changed but no the object itself
